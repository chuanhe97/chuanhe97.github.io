I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/cs'>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at University of Minnesota, working with <a href='https://sunju.org/'>Professor Ju Sun</a>. 

I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/isye">Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> at University of Minnesota under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://zhaosong-lu.github.io/index.html">Professor Zhaosong Lu</a>. I received my bachelor's degree from the <a target="_blank" href="https://math.xmu.edu.cn/en/">School of Mathematical Sciences</a> at Xiamen University, with thesis advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/">Professor Wen Huang</a>. 

I am interested in the dynamic intersections of data science and optimization. My current research centers on building theory for structured optimization in machine learning and creating algorithm packages for data-driven optimization problems.

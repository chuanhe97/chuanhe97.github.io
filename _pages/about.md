Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Minnesota working with Professor Ju Sun. Before that, I earned my PhD from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the same university under the supervision of Professor Zhaosong Lu. I received my bachelor's degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Xiamen University, with thesis advised by Professor Wen Huang. I am interested in the dynamic intersections of data science and optimization. My current research centers on building theory for structured optimization in machine learning and creating algorithm packages for data-driven optimization problems.

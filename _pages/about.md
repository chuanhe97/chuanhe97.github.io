I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/mai'>Department of Mathematics</a> at Linköping University.  

I was a postdoctoral associate in the <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/cs'>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at Universitof Minnesota, working with <a href='https://sunju.org/'>Professor Ju Sun</a>. I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/isye">Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> at University of Minnesota under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://zhaosong-lu.github.io/index.html">Professor Zhaosong Lu</a>. I received my bachelor's degree from the <a target="_blank" href="https://math.xmu.edu.cn/en/">School of Mathematical Sciences</a> at Xiamen University, with thesis advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/">Professor Wen Huang</a>. 

My research interests center around data science and optimization, with topics including deep learning, decentralized optimization, large-scale optimization, and high-order methods. I am also interested in applications of machine learning in healthcare, scientific computing, image science, and engineering.
